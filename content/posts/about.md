### Mission Statement
To promote Queer liberation on the Olympic Peninsula by raising awareness and
protecting our own.

### Thank You For Being
You are welcome here. Clallam|LGBTQIA2S+ is a safe place to explore the diverse
topics of sex, gender, and identity. This site is fueled by Queer Anarchy, not
sponsorship. Queer liberation is the future of a polite society that brings itself
to fruition willingly.

### About the Author
Clallam|LGBTQIA2S+ is entirely run by A Girl Named Blaze™. She has been a resident
 of Clallam County for 35 of her 37 years on this planet. She is developing the
 site and writing in her spare time, so updates are sporadic at best. A Girl
 Named Blaze™ is employed full-time in a public-facing position.
